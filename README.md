# UiGAN

This repo is developed and maintained by @siddhantpp and @pranitkothari for Stanford course CS230 - Deep Learning.

UiGAN is further divided into UiStyleGAN and UiCodeGAN.

Currently our work on UiStyleGAN is in the experimental phase and  is based on [Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks](https://junyanz.github.io/CycleGAN/) and its [PyTorch](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) implementation for CycleGAN and pix2pix.

Similarly, UiCodeGAN is also experimentally based on [pix2code](https://github.com/tonybeltramelli/pix2code) and [screenshotToCode](https://github.com/emilwallner/Screenshot-to-code/tree/master/floydhub)
